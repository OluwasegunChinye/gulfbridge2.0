              <div>
                <p> We start our engagement with you, our valued client, with a thorough understanding of your business (strategy, operating model, etc.) and its need(s). We naturally prefer to start with a brief from you to us but where that is not possible for whatever reasons, we will come in to gather information ourselves by carrying out surveys and other information gathering tools. With this knowledge, we formulate your recruitment, training and other needs, seek your approval to our proposed interventions, and we work from there by giving you a project plan.</p>
                <p>A staff is dedicated to liaise with you, so that you are kept abreast of the emerging issues and what we have done or intend to do about them. Critical issues like recruitment and other activities that have financial actions will be subject to your approval. Regular meetings at predetermined intervals will help keep you up to date on all critical aspects of issues outsourced to us so that you can devote a higher percentage of your time to other core HR issues..</p>
